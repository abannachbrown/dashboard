    likewise we did not find significant enrichment of pss motifs at the breakpoints of structural variants and genomic rearrangements in breast carcinomas lacking pgbd5 expression even though these breast carcinoma genomes were characterized by high rates of genomic instability (supplementary data set 1).;     in total 580 (52%) of 1121 somatic genomic rearrangements detected in rhabdoid tumors contained pss sequences near their rearrangement breakpoints (supplementary data set 1).;     notably we found recurrent pss-containing genomic rearrangements affecting the cntnap2 tenm2 tenm3 and tet2 genes (fig. 1a–c supplementary fig. 3c and supplementary data set 1).;     interestingly some of the observed genomic rearrangements with pss-containing breakpoints in rhabdoid tumors involved smarcb1 deletions (fig. 1ab and supplementary data set 1) thus suggesting that in a subset of rhabdoid tumors pgbd5 activity itself may contribute to the somatic inactivation of smarcb1 in rhabdoid tumorigenesis.;     similarly we observed recurrent interchromosomal translocations and complex structural rearrangements containing breakpoints with the pss motifs that involved smarcb1 (fig. 1b and supplementary data set 1) including chromosomal translocations as previously observed through cytogenetic methods17.;     chip–seq genome tracks of pgbd5 (blue) compared with its sequencing input (gray) and lys27-acetylated (h3k27ac) and lys4-trimethylated (h3k4me3) histone h3 (bottom) suggesting bound pgbd5 transposase protein complex are shown.  neomycin-resistance gene (neor) flanked by a human pss sequence as identified from rhabdoid tumor rearrangement breakpoints (supplementary figs. 2 and 3 and supplementary data set 1) lepidopteran piggybac inverted terminal repeat (itr) transposon sequence30 or control plasmids lacking flanking transposon elements (fig. 2b).;     to determine the genetic basis of pgbd5-induced cell transformation we sequenced whole genomes of pgbd5-induced tumors as well as control gfp-expressing and nontransduced rpe cells by using massively parallel paired-end illumina sequencing at a coverage in excess of 80-fold for over 90% of the genome (supplementary data set 1).;     as for the rhabdoid tumor genome analysis we used the assembly-based algorithm lasv as well as conventional techniques3334 (supplementary table 3 supplementary figs. 9–11 and supplementary data set 1).;     the identified rearrangements were characterized by intrachromosomal deletions with a median length of 183 bp in agreement with their apparent limited detectability through conventional genome analysis methods as well as inversions duplications and translocations (supplementary fig. 12a–c and supplementary data set 1).;     error bars s.d. of three independent experiments.  the genomic rearrangements found in pgbd5-transformed rpe cells revealed significant enrichment of pss motifs at the breakpoints of pgbd5-induced tumor structural variants (p = 7.2 × 10−3 hypergeometric test; fig. 7b and supplementary data set 1).;     we independently verified these findings by using the direct tree-graph-based comparative smufin analysis method (supplementary fig. 12a and supplementary data set 1).;     we detected 59 pgbd5-induced structural variants per tumor 42 (71%) of which were deletions 36 (61%) of which affected regulatory intergenic elements and 13 (22%) of which contained pss motifs at their breakpoints (supplementary data set 1).   data availability. genome and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive and gene expression omnibus databases (bioproject 320056 and data set gse81160,plasmids available from addgene https://www.addgene.org/ alex_kentsis/;

    the clustering was efficient for genes possessing both strong and weak amino acid signatures and is hence not a function of the strength of metabolic impact as long as metabolic changes are detectable (data s1).;
