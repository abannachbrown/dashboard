data s1; figure s1).;     among a group of 1571 differentially evolving genes there was specific enrichment for genes related to photoreception (data s1) and for the metabolic pathway of glycerolipid metabolism which is essential for the synthesis of triacylglycerols (tags) the precursor of fatty acids (figure 2a).;     see also data s1 table s1 and figure s3.  fastest gene was interleukin 4 (dn/ds of 2.3072 top 1% in a phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood [paml] analysis) (data s1).;     as well as humans and close relatives of the marmot we chose species known for very low heterozygosity often associated with conservation risk habitat loss extreme isolation or artificial inbreeding [15] (data s1).;     lower heterozygosity was found only in the lab mouse (129p2/olahsd) artificially backcrossed for decades (0.05/kb; data s1).;     the heterozygosity for a panel of other mammalian genomes has been determined by remapping the original sequence reads used to assemble their reference genomes using identical software parameters (data s1) so that heterozygosity values are directly comparable.;     see also data s1 table s2 and figures s3 and s4.;     to distinguish between these possibilities we resequenced a further 11 alpine marmot individuals (data s1) both from the reference population and two additional populations from gsies a neighboring valley less than 50 km east of mauls and la grande sassière (lgs) nature reserve french alps _x005F_x0003_390 km west (figure 3b) to obtain two male and two female genomes per population.;     the animals’ sex was confirmed by genome analysis (data s1).;     in order to minimize potential technology biases in low-frequency variant calling [33] genomic dna was sequenced by two complementary sequencing technologies (illumina and roche/454) and different types of library protocols for illumina sequencing (data s1).;     using a hybrid assembly approach to make the best use of short- and long-read data we assembled a genome consensus sequence of 2.51 gbp with a contig n50 size of _x005F_x0003_44 kbp scaffold n50 size of 5.6 mbp and superscaffold n50 size of 31.3 mbp (data s1).;     the large superscaffold n50 size was achieved by collinearity analyses based on the genome of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel current biology 29 1712–1720.e1–e7 may 20 2019 e1   (ictidomys tridecemlineatus the closest relative for which a genome was available) and the house mouse (mus musculus data s1).;     eventually we yielded a reference set of 22349 protein coding genes (data s1).;     of this gene set _x005F_x0003_19000 genes could be annotated with gene symbols and _x005F_x0003_14700 associated to functional pathways (data s1).;     we produced a high sequencing coverage based on the paired end libraries and supplementary lower coverage using the matepair libraries and the 454 technology (sequencing statistics are given in data s1).;     sequence data were generated by either hiseq2500 (2 3 100 bp) or nextseq500 sequencers (2 3 150 bp) (data s1) assembly of a reference genome for the alpine marmot prior to assembly we filtered high quality non-duplicate illumina reads and removed adaptor sequences from the paired end reads.;     heterozygosity analysis across species and snp calling of alpine marmot individuals complementing the alpine marmot data the paired-end sequence read data genome assembly data and annotation data of other mammalian species were downloaded from their respective sources (data s1).;

10.1038/s41467-018-08053-5,2019,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,supplement,,FALSE,,,using approximate joint association analysis implemented in gcta9 (see methods) we ﬁrst identiﬁed 212 variants that were independently associated (i.e. with gcta-cojo joint analysis p < 5 × 10−8) with breast cancer in a gwas dataset of 122977 cases and 105974 controls2 (supplementary data 1).;     we extracted association summary statistics from 117 published eqtl datasets identiﬁed in ﬁve broad tissue types: adipose breast individual immune cell types spleen and whole-blood (supplementary data 2).;     the mean number of sentinel eqtl per gene ranged from 1.0 to 2.9 across the 117 eqtl datasets considered which varied considerably in sample size and number of genes tested (supplementary data 2).;     2  when we intersected the list of variants from the joint association analysis and the list of sentinel eqtl from published datasets we identiﬁed 46 sentinel risk variants that were in high ld (r2 > 0.8) with one or more sentinel eqtl implicating 88 individual genes at 46 loci as likely targets of breast cancer risk variants (supplementary data 3 and 4).;     twenty-ﬁve risk variants had a single predicted target gene 10 had two and 11 had three or more (supplementary data 5).;     of the 88 genes 75 (85%) were identiﬁed based on eqtl from whole-blood 10 (11%) from immune cells (pex14 rnf115 tnnt3 efemp2 sdha ap4b1 bcl2l15 btn3a2 hist1h2bl syne1) and three (4%) exclusively from adipose tissue (znf703 hapln4 tm6sf2) (supplementary data 4).;     however it is noteworthy that an additional 29 sentinel eqtl listed in supplementary data 3 had a modest yet signiﬁcant association with the expression of the respective target gene in breast tissue (gtex v7 n = 251) suggesting that larger eqtl datasets of this tissue will be informative to identify the target genes of sentinel risk variants.;     a total of 62 genes were included in the list of 925 targets predicted in the original gwas using inquisit2 while 26 genes represent previously unreported predictions (supplementary data 5).;     of the 77 genes for which this information could be obtained (detailed in supplementary data 4) the protective allele was associated with lower expression for 43 genes (e.g.;     rccd1 atg10 ell and tlr1) (summarized in table 1 and supplementary data 6).;     results from this analysis are presented in supplementary data 7.;     the inconsistent results observed for the remaining six genes were likely caused by technical biases (possible explanations in supplementary data 7).;     similar ﬁndings were  obtained when considering whole-blood transcriptome prediction models based on data from the gtex consortium (supplementary data 7).;     gene structures from gencode v19 gene annotations are shown and the predicted target genes shown in red. a the sentinel risk variant at this locus (rs875311) was in ld with sentinel eqtl for cfl1 (in whole blood) and for efemp2 (in cd8+ t cells only). b the sentinel risk variant (rs11049425 target gene: ccdc91) represents a secondary association signal in this region. c the sentinel risk variant at this locus (rs8105994) is in ld with sentinel eqtl for two previously unreported target gene predictions (ac010335.1 and lrrc25) and four previously predicted targets (ctd-3137h5.1 ell pgpep1 and ssbp4;

    we only considered enhancers that overlapped a sentinel risk variant (or a proxy with r2 > 0.80) and restricted our analysis to blood cells (supplementary data 8) given that most target genes were identiﬁed based on eqtl data from wholeblood.;     we found that 25 (28%) of the 88 target gene predictions were supported by functional data (supplementary data 9).;     we then applied the eugene gene-based approach67 to the adjusted gwas results considering in a single association analysis cis eqtl identiﬁed in ﬁve broad tissue types: adipose breast immune cells spleen and whole-blood (supplementary data 10).;     the speciﬁc eqtl included in the gene-based test for each of these 11 genes which were located in six loci >1 mb apart are listed in supplementary data 10.;     for example the eugene gene-based p-value for gstm2 was 6.6 × 10−8 while the best individual eqtl showed more moderate association with breast cancer risk (gcta-cojo conditional association p = 4.1 × 10−5; ﬁve of the 14 sentinel eqtl tested for this gene were nominally associated with disease risk (supplementary data 11).;     when we considered information from all eqtl associated with disease risk for each of the 11 genes (supplementary data 11) we found that decreased disease risk was consistently associated with decreased gene expression for three genes and increased expression for ﬁve genes (table 3 and supplementary data 12).;     we found that 11 of the 88 target genes had a nominally signiﬁcant gene-based association in the adjusted gwas results (eugene p < 0.05; supplementary data 13) with one remaining signiﬁcant after correcting for multiple testing: cbx6 (eugene p = 0.0002).;
